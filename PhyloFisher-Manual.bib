	abstract = {Detection of protein homology via sequence similarity has important applications in biology, from protein structure and function prediction to reconstruction of phylogenies. Although current methods for aligning protein sequences are powerful, challenges remain, including problems with homologous overextension of alignments and with regions under convergent evolution. Here, we test the ability of the profile hidden Markov model method {HMMER}3 to correctly assign homologous sequences to \&gt;13 000 manually curated families from the Pfam database. We identify problem families using protein regions that match two or more Pfam families not currently annotated as related in Pfam. We find that {HMMER}3 E-value estimates seem to be less accurate for families that feature periodic patterns of compositional bias, such as the ones typically observed in coiled-coils. These results support the continued use of manually curated inclusion thresholds in the Pfam database, especially on the subset of families that have been identified as problematic in experiments such as these. They also highlight the need for developing new methods that can correct for this particular type of compositional bias.},

The large-scale multi-gene nature of these datasets renders impractical or impossible detailed manual curation of sequences, but few tools exist that can automate this task. To address this issue, we developed a new method that takes as input a set of unaligned homologous sequences and uses an explicit probabilistic approach to identify and mask regions with non-homologous adjacent characters. These regions are defined as sharing no statistical support for homology with any other sequence in the set, which can result from e.g. sequencing errors or gene prediction errors creating frameshifts. Our methodology is implemented in the program {PREQUAL}, which is a fast and accurate tool for high-throughput filtering of sequences. The program is primarily aimed at amino acid sequences, although it can handle protein coding {DNA} sequences as well. It is fully customizable to allow fine-tuning of the filtering sensitivity.The program {PREQUAL} is written in C/C++ and available through a {GNU} {GPL} v3.0 at https://github.com/simonwhelan/prequal.Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.},

	abstract = {Multiple sequence alignment ({MSA}) is ubiquitous in evolution and bioinformatics. {MSAs} are usually taken to be a known and fixed quantity on which to perform downstream analysis despite extensive evidence that {MSA} accuracy and uncertainty affect results. These errors are known to cause a wide range of problems for downstream evolutionary inference, ranging from false inference of positive selection to long branch attraction artifacts. The most popular approach to dealing with this problem is to remove (filter) specific columns in the {MSA} that are thought to be prone to error. Although popular, this approach has had mixed success and several studies have even suggested that filtering might be detrimental to phylogenetic studies. We present a graph-based clustering method to address {MSA} uncertainty and error in the software Divvier (available at https://github.com/simonwhelan/Divvier), which uses a probabilistic model to identify clusters of characters that have strong statistical evidence of shared homology. These clusters can then be used to either filter characters from the {MSA} (partial filtering) or represent each of the clusters in a new column (divvying). We validate Divvier through its performance on real and simulated benchmarks, finding Divvier substantially outperforms existing filtering software by retaining more true pairwise homologies calls and removing more false positive pairwise homologies. We also find that Divvier, in contrast to other filtering tools, can alleviate long branch attraction artifacts induced by {MSA} and reduces the variation in tree estimates caused by {MSA} uncertainty.},

Methodology/Principal Findings: Where {FastTree} 1 used nearest-neighbor interchanges ({NNIs}) and the minimum-evolution criterion to improve the tree, {FastTree} 2 adds minimum-evolution subtree-pruning-regrafting ({SPRs}) and maximum-likelihood {NNIs}. {FastTree} 2 uses heuristics to restrict the search for better trees and estimates a rate of evolution for each site (the ''{CAT}'' approximation). Nevertheless, for both simulated and genuine alignments, {FastTree} 2 is slightly more accurate than a standard implementation of maximum-likelihood {NNIs} ({PhyML} 3 with default settings). Although {FastTree} 2 is not quite as accurate as methods that use maximum-likelihood {SPRs}, most of the splits that disagree are poorly supported, and for large alignments, {FastTree} 2 is 100-1,000 times faster. {FastTree} 2 inferred a topology and likelihood-based local support values for 237,882 distinct 16S ribosomal {RNAs} on a desktop computer in 22 hours and 5.8 gigabytes of memory.

	abstract = {revious work has shown that it is often essential to account for the variation in rates at different sites in phylogenetic models in order to avoid phylogenetic artifacts such as long branch attraction. In most current models, the gamma distribution is used for the rates-across-sites distributions and is implemented as an equal-probability discrete gamma. In this article, we introduce discrete distribution estimates with large numbers of equally spaced rate categories allowing us to investigate the appropriateness of the gamma model. With large numbers of rate categories, these discrete estimates are flexible enough to approximate the shape of almost any distribution. Likelihood ratio statistical tests and a nonparametric bootstrap confidence-bound estimation procedure based on the discrete estimates are presented that can be used to test the fit of a parametric family. We applied the methodology to several different protein data sets, and found that although the gamma model often provides a good parametric model for this type of data, rate estimates from an equal-probability discrete gamma model with a small number of categories will tend to underestimate the largest rates. In cases when the gamma model assumption is in doubt, rate estimates coming from the discrete rate distribution estimate with a large number of rate categories provide a robust alternative to gamma estimates. An alternative implementation of the gamma distribution is proposed that, for equal numbers of rate categories, is computationally more efficient during optimization than the standard gamma implementation and can provide more accurate estimates of site rates.},

Yet, many bioinformatics tools for such analyses have focused on specific clades, with greatest attention paid to plants, animals, and fungi. The rapid increase in high-throughput sequencing ({HTS}) data from diverse lineages now provides opportunities to estimate evolutionary relationships and gene family evolution across the eukaryotic tree of life. At the same time, these types of data are known to be error-prone (e.g., substitutions, contamination). To address these opportunities and challenges, we have refined a phylogenomic pipeline, now named {PhyloToL}, to allow easy incorporation of data from {HTS} studies, to automate production of both {MSAs} and gene trees, and to identify and remove contaminants. {PhyloToL} is designed for phylogenomic analyses of diverse lineages across the tree of life (i.e., at scales of \&gt;100 My). We demonstrate the power of {PhyloToL} by assessing stop codon usage in Ciliophora, identifying contamination in a taxon- and gene-rich database and exploring the evolutionary history of chromosomes in the kinetoplastid parasite Trypanosoma brucei, the causative agent of African sleeping sickness. Benchmarking {PhyloToL}’s homology assessment against that of {OrthoMCL} and a published paper on superfamilies of bacterial and eukaryotic organellar outer membrane pore-forming proteins demonstrates the power of our approach for determining gene family membership and inferring gene trees. {PhyloToL} is highly flexible and allows users to easily explore {HTS} data, test hypotheses about phylogeny and gene family evolution and combine outputs with third-party tools (e.g., {PhyloChromoMap}, {iGTP}).},

Phylogenomic data sets commonly include transcriptomes and low-coverage genomes that are incomplete and contain errors and isoforms. These properties can severely violate the underlying assumptions of orthology inference with existing heuristics. We present a procedure that uses phylogenies for both homology and orthology assignment. The procedure first uses similarity scores to infer putative homologs that are then aligned, constructed into phylogenies, and pruned of spurious branches caused by deep paralogs, misassembly, frameshifts, or recombination. These final homologs are then used to identify orthologs. We explore four alternative tree-based orthology inference approaches, of which two are new. These accommodate gene and genome duplications as well as gene tree discordance. We demonstrate these methods in three published data sets including the grape family, Hymenoptera, and millipedes with divergence times ranging from approximately 100 to over 400 Ma. The procedure significantly increased the completeness and accuracy of the inferred homologs and orthologs. We also found that data sets that are more recently diverged and/or include more high-coverage genomes had more complete sets of orthologs. To explicitly evaluate sources of conflicting phylogenetic signals, we applied serial jackknife analyses of gene regions keeping each locus intact. The methods described here can scale to over 100 taxa. They have been implemented in python with independent scripts for each step, making it easy to modify or incorporate them into existing pipelines.

	abstract = {A phylogenetic analysis of the small subunit ribosomal {RNA} (16S-like {rRNA}) coding region from Hexamita inflata demonstrates that parasitism alone cannot explain early diverging eukaryotic lineages. Parasitic and free-living diplomonads, as well as trichomonads and microsporidia, diverge at the base of the eukaryotic tree. The relative branching order of diplomonads, trichomonads and microsporidia is influenced by outlying prokaryotic taxa with different G + C compositions in their {rRNA} coding regions. The high G + C prokaryotes position Giardia lamblia at the base of the eukaryotic tree but split diplomonads into a paraphyletic group. When the outlying groups are restricted to {rRNAs} with nominal G + C compositions, diplomonads form a monophyletic group that diverged after the microsporidia and trichomonads. This unstable branching pattern correlates with unusual nucleotide compositions in the {rRNAs} of G. lamblia (75\% G + C) and Vairimorpha necatrix (35\% G + C). In contrast, the 51\% G + C composition of the H. inflata {rRNA} is typical of other eukaryotic {rRNAs}. Its divergence after trichomonads is strongly supported by bootstrap replicates in distance analyses that do not include G. lamblia. Because of a low G + C composition in its {rRNA} coding region, the phylogenetic placement of V. necatrix is uncertain and the identity of the deepest branching eukaryotic lineage is ambiguous.},

Resolving the phylogenetic position of these “orphan” groups is important, especially those that originated early in evolution, because they represent missing evolutionary links between established groups. Telonemia is one such orphan taxon for which little is known. The group is composed of molecularly diverse biflagellated protists, often prevalent although not abundant in aquatic environments. Telonemia has been hypothesized to represent a deeply diverging eukaryotic phylum but no consensus exists as to where it is placed in the tree. Here, we established cultures and report the phylogenomic analyses of three new transcriptome data sets for divergent telonemid lineages. All our phylogenetic reconstructions, based on 248 genes and using site-heterogeneous mixture models, robustly resolve the evolutionary origin of Telonemia as sister to the Sar supergroup. This grouping remains well supported when as few as 60\% of the genes are randomly subsampled, thus is not sensitive to the sets of genes used but requires a minimal alignment length to recover enough phylogenetic signal. Telonemia occupies a crucial position in the tree to examine the origin of Sar, one of the most lineage-rich eukaryote supergroups. We propose the moniker “{TSAR}” to accommodate this new mega-assemblage in the phylogeny of eukaryotes.},

First observed in the nineteenth century, hemimastigotes are free-living predatory protists with two rows of flagella and a unique cell architecture5–7; to our knowledge, no molecular sequence data or cultures are currently available for this group. Here we report phylogenomic analyses based on high-coverage, cultivation-independent transcriptomics that place Hemimastigophora outside of all established eukaryote supergroups. They instead comprise an independent supra-kingdom-level lineage that most likely forms a sister clade to the ‘Diaphoretickes’ half of eukaryote diversity (that is, the ‘stramenopiles, alveolates and Rhizaria’ supergroup (Sar), Archaeplastida and Cryptista, as well as other major groups). The previous ranking of Hemimastigophora as a phylum understates the evolutionary distinctiveness of this group, which has considerable importance for investigations into the deep-level evolutionary history of eukaryotic life—ranging from understanding the origins of fundamental cell systems to placing the root of the tree. We have also established the first culture of a hemimastigote (Hemimastix kukwesjijk sp. nov.), which will facilitate future genomic and cell-biological investigations into eukaryote evolution and the last eukaryotic common ancestor.},

Heterogeneity in the amino acid substitution process between sites is not modeled by commonly used empirical amino acid exchange matrices. Such model misspecification can lead to artefacts in phylogenetic estimation such as long-branch attraction. Although sophisticated site-heterogeneous mixture models have been developed to address this problem in both Bayesian and maximum likelihood ({ML}) frameworks, their formidable computational time and memory usage severely limits their use in large phylogenomic analyses. Here we propose a posterior mean site frequency ({PMSF}) method as a rapid and efficient approximation to full empirical profile mixture models for {ML} analysis. The {PMSF} approach assigns a conditional mean amino acid frequency profile to each site calculated based on a mixture model fitted to the data using a preliminary guide tree. These {PMSF} profiles can then be used for in-depth tree-searching in place of the full mixture model. Compared with widely used empirical mixture models with \$k\$ classes, our implementation of {PMSF} in {IQ}-{TREE} (http://www.iqtree.org) speeds up the computation by approximately \$k\$/1.5-fold and requires a small fraction of the {RAM}. Furthermore, this speedup allows, for the first time, full nonparametric bootstrap analyses to be conducted under complex site-heterogeneous models on large concatenated data matrices. Our simulations and empirical data analyses demonstrate that {PMSF} can effectively ameliorate long-branch attraction artefacts. In some empirical and simulation settings {PMSF} provided more accurate estimates of phylogenies than the mixture models from which they derive.},

However, due to prohibitive computational times, maximum likelihood implementations utilize fixed component frequency vectors inferred from sequences in a database that are external to the alignment under analysis. Here, we propose a composite likelihood approach to estimation of component frequencies for a mixture model that directly uses the data from the alignment of interest. In the common case that the number of taxa under study is not large, several adjustments to the default composite likelihood are shown to be necessary. In simulations, the approach is shown to provide large improvements over hierarchical clustering.

Red algae are a diverse and species-rich group, members of which are typically photoautotrophic, but are united by a number of highly derived characteristics: they have relatively small intron-poor genomes, reduced metabolism and lack cytoskeletal structures that are associated with motility, flagella and centrioles. This suggests that marked gene loss occurred around their origin4; however, this is difficult to reconstruct because they differ so much from the other archaeplastid lineages, and the relationships between these lineages are unclear. Here we describe the novel eukaryotic phylum Rhodelphidia and, using phylogenomics, demonstrate that it is a closely related sister to red algae. However, the characteristics of the two Rhodelphis species described here are nearly opposite to those that define red algae: they are non-photosynthetic, flagellate predators with gene-rich genomes, along with a relic genome-lacking primary plastid that probably participates in haem synthesis. Overall, these findings alter our views of the origins of Rhodophyta, and Archaeplastida evolution as a whole, as they indicate that mixotrophic feeding—that is, a combination of predation and phototrophy—persisted well into the evolution of the group.},

Using vital  mitochondrial staining and cell sorting by flow cytometry, a single cell-derived  culture was established. The cells are biflagellate, 2.5-3.8×2-2.5 µm in size, lack  plastids and display a novel stereotypic cycle of cell motility (described as the  "jump, drag, and skedaddle"-cycle). They consist of two hemispherical parts  separated by a deep cleft, an anterior part that contains all major cell organelles  including the flagellar apparatus, and a posterior part housing vacuoles/vesicles  and the feeding apparatus, both parts separated by a large vacuolar cisterna. From  serial section analyses of cells, fixed at putative stages of the feeding cycle, it  is concluded that cells are not bacterivorous, but feed on small marine colloids of  less than 150 nm diameter by fluid-phase, bulk flow endocytosis. Based on the novel  features of cell motility, ultrastructure and feeding, and their isolated  phylogenetic position, we establish a new phylum, Picozoa, for Picomonas judraskeda,  representing an apparently widespread and ecologically important group of  heterotrophic picoeukaryotes, formerly known as 'picobiliphytes'.},

The distribution of the rates across the sequence positions generally fits a Γ distribution. Models of sequence evolution were accordingly designed and led to improved phylogenetic reconstruction. However, it has been convincingly demonstrated that the evolutionary rate of a given position is not always constant throughout time. We called such within-site rate variations heterotachy (for “different speed” in Greek). Yet, heterotachy was found among homologous sequences of distantly related organisms, often with different functions. In such cases, the functional constraints are likely different, which would explain the different distribution of variable sites. To evaluate the importance of heterotachy, we focused on amino acid sequences of mitochondrial cytochrome b, for which the function is likely the same in all vertebrates. Using 2,038 sequences, we demonstrate that 95\% of the variable positions are heterotachous, i.e., underwent dramatic variations of substitution rate among vertebrate lineages. Heterotachy even occurs at small evolutionary scale, and in these cases it is very unlikely to be related to functional changes. Since a large number of sequences are required to efficiently detect heterotachy, the extent of this phenomenon could not be estimated for all proteins yet. It could be as large as for cytochrome b, since this protein is not a peculiar case. The observations made here open several new avenues of research, such as the understanding of the evolution of functional constraints or the improvement of phylogenetic reconstruction methods.}",

    abstract = "{Microsporidia branch at the base of eukaryotic phylogenies inferred from translation elongation factor 1α (EF-1α) sequences. Because these parasitic eukaryotes are fungi (or close relatives of fungi), it is widely accepted that fast-evolving microsporidian sequences are artifactually “attracted” to the long branch leading to the archaebacterial (outgroup) sequences (“long-branch attraction,” or “LBA”). However, no previous studies have explicitly determined the reason(s) why the artifactual allegiance of microsporidia and archaebacteria (“M + A”) is recovered by all phylogenetic methods, including maximum likelihood, a method that is supposed to be resistant to classical LBA. Here we show that the M + A affinity can be attributed to those alignment sites associated with large differences in evolutionary site rates between the eukaryotic and archaebacterial subtrees. Therefore, failure to model the significant evolutionary rate distribution differences (covarion shifts) between the ingroup and outgroup sequences is apparently responsible for the artifactual basal position of microsporidia in phylogenetic analyses of EF-1α sequences. Currently, no evolutionary model that accounts for discrete changes in the site rate distribution on particular branches is available for either protein or nucleotide level phylogenetic analysis, so the same artifacts may affect many other “deep” phylogenies. Furthermore, given the relative similarity of the site rate patterns of microsporidian and archaebacterial EF-1α proteins (“parallel site rate variation”), we suggest that the microsporidian orthologs may have lost some eukaryotic EF-1α–specific nontranslational functions, exemplifying the extreme degree of reduction in this parasitic lineage.}",

    abstract = "{We investigate the use of Markov models of evolution for reduced amino acid alphabets or bins of amino acids. The use of reduced amino acid alphabets can ameliorate effects of model misspecification and saturation. We present algorithms for 2 different ways of automating the construction of bins: minimizing criteria based on properties of rate matrices and minimizing criteria based on properties of alignments. By simulation, we show that in the absence of model misspecification, the loss of information due to binning is found to be insubstantial, and the use of Markov models at the binned level is found to be almost as effective as the more appropriate missing data approach. By applying these approaches to real data sets where compositional heterogeneity and/or saturation appear to be causing biased tree estimation, we find that binning can improve topological estimation in practice.}",
